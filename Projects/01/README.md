Team Members:
Brian Zdarsky, Brian Knorr, Jeffrey Overholt, Joshua Barrett, Natalie Piehl

Project description/outline:

We want to investigate the interplay between COVID data, library usage, and sidewalk cafe permit applications.

Research questions to answer:
Were the changes in sidewalk cafe permit applications from 2019 to 2021 correlated to COVID-19 severity?
Was library visitation and circulation up in pandemic-heavy times?
Were more people renewing books and/or media during the pandemic?
What neighborhoods in Chicago saw the most dramatic change in library usage from 2019 to 2021?
Socioeconomic status make-up of these neighborhoods?
